## Problem:

As Muslim professionals, at times we find ourselves in situations where our colleagues add meetings to our calendar that clashes with prayers times without prior notice. This sometimes cause some disruption in our plans which could be avoided by just differing the meeting by few minutes. 

## Solution:

This project aims to solve this issue by adding prayer times to their calendar, where the user can subscribe to the paryer time calendar depends on his location, timezone, working hours, etc ...

## Sugested Implementation:

The solution will be implemented in a website where the users will input their: City, Period, Calculation Method ...
Then the app will return a link to copy and use it to subscribe to it from their Outlook or Google calendar.
